11.0:1 Introduction.
12.0:This project involves the development of an application through which doctors can obtain and share essential patient information and can view aggregate patient data.
          doctor;obtain;essential patient information - R
          doctor;share;essential patient information - C
          doctor;view;aggregate patient datum - R
13.0:Currently, access to a patient's history regarding previous medical problems, previous surgery, medications, allergies and other factors is often difficult or obtainable only from a patient's recollection.
14.0:Now, as more hospitals and doctor's offices are automated, this information is available electronically.
15.0:However, it is not accessible by other doctors, and is often only viewed through some proprietary software so it can not be shared.
16.0:The final product is a site where health care workers can access important patient information, the non-emergency access can be controlled, and all access would be tracked.
          health care worker;access;important patient information - R
17.0:Security and privacy of such a system is of paramount importance.
18.0:HIPAA rules protect patients' information and also allow a patient to dictate who can access this information.
